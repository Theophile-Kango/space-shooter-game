## How to play ?

Before starting the game, the player must fill in a name field and at the end of the game he can see if his score is among the top 10 players by clicking on the players button.

The game begins with an airplane in full space, and the mission is to prevent the meteors from reaching the earth by shooting at them.
The player's score increases when he destroys a meteor.

The player has 3 life levels at the start, when the plane crosses with a meteor, the player's score decreases.

After one minute of play 2 level of life are added to the player and he leaves from level 1 to level 2 where there are more meteors and they come at a high speed than at level 1

After a minute another 2 life level are added to the player and he goes to level 3 where the meteors come at a higher speed than at level 1 and 2.

The game ends when the player's standard of living is 0.
